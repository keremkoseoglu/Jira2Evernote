# Jira2Evernote

This old Python app was written to read an issue from Jira and transfer to [Evernote](www.evernote.com).

Since I no longer use [Evernote](www.evernote.com) and use [Notion](www.notion.so) instead, this project is abandoned and replaced by [Jira2Notion](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/Jira2Notion).
